# APP-HTS-Trip-Length-Shiny-2012

This repo contains the code to create trip length distributions from 2012 Houeshold Travel Survey (HTS) data for groups of number of workers, vehicle ownership, mode, and trip purpose.

From this data, a R-Shiny app was created to display information.

The app is found here: [https://wfrc.shinyapps.io/2023-utah-household-travel-survey-trip-duration-distribution/](https://wfrc.shinyapps.io/2012-utah-household-travel-survey-trip-length-distribution/)
